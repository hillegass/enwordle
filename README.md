# enwordle
Using information theory, this is the optimal wordle player.  It is written in Rust and runs on the command-line.

## Theory

When you pick a word in Wordle, the game responds with 1 of 243 responses.  There are five spaces and three possible responses for each (not present, wrong place, right place). 5^3 = 243.  You get the most information about the word if each response is equally likely â€” that is, in the language of information theory, the response has the most possible entropy.

At each step, this program figures out the words that will evoke the most entropy from Wordle.  It even tells you how many bits of information you are likely to get from playing the word.

This is the optimal strategy if you assume all the words in the list are equally likely to be the answer. Other people have done similar systems that do not make this assumption:

## Usage

I usually pick the first word on the list that I think the New York Times might actually use.

To run

```
cargo run --release
```

Example: playing for "brain":
